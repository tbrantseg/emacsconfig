* Using this repo
Add the following two lines to your .emacs or init.el

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/emacs-init")
  (require 'tb-emacs-init)
#+END_SRC

Still to add: Ensuring all necessary packages are loaded.

- The =regen-compilation-db= function bound to f4 looks for a script in the project root called =db_regen.sh=. Ideally this should be generated by the function itself.

- Directory-local variables are required for the f4 and f5 keybinds. Make sure to set =compile-command= as appropriate and set =compdb-command= to the location of =db_regen.sh=
